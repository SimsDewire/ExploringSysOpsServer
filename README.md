# ExploringSysOpsServer  

This repository is a part of a school-project called Student Inovation Mid Sweden, or SIMS for short. What we, as the Dewire group,
will do for this project is to Explore the world of System Operators (Exploring SysOps) where the focus will be on how to improve
system surveilance.  

**ExploringSysOpsServer**  
This is the server-side of the project.  
To set up the server, you need to run the commands: _"npm install"_, _"mkdir -p data/db"_ and then _"npm start"_.  
This will start the server and initilize the mongoDB.
